measuringworm.com

3. What's the link to your repository on github with your code?

https://github.com/boqolo/cs4550hw02/tree/master

4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?

80% of the CSS exercises and 40% of the HTML exercises. 
I have some previous experience with HTML/CSS and so did not
do the exercises for parts that I felt I had an understanding.

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?

I feel like I am about at an intermediate level now and
have a solid grasp such that I can understand online 
references for new concepts in both.

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?

I prioritized parts I was most unfamiliar with and
completed around 50% of the exercises.

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?

I feel much more comfortable with the language features
and think that I have a good intuition of it.
The functional programming design that JS comes with,
though, I am less comfortable with.

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)

Yes

9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

I think I had some trouble trying to design this in the Functional
style. My first run through was more procedural but felt
disorganized so I refactored and naturally had a run in with bugs.
